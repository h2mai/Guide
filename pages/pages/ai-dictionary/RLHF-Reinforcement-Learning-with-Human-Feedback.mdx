# Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is a method of training models using rewards and punishments provided by humans. The model is presented with a series of prompts and generates responses, which are then evaluated by human trainers. If the response is deemed good, the model receives a reward; if it is bad, the model receives a punishment. Over time, the model learns to generate responses that maximize its rewards and minimize its punishments, leading to improved performance.
