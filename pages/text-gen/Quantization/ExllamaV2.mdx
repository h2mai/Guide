# Exllamav2: Turboderp's Fantastical Quantization Method

This is a quantization method for graphics cards. It is also aimed at individual use. Exllamav2 is a great choice for people who wish to have high speed, and intend to only perform one instance at a time.

Thankfully, Turboderp, the creator, keeps his guide updated and also holds Exllama under an MIT license. You can find resources on how to get it installed and working for yourself, [here](https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2).
