# Instruction Tuning

Instruction tuning is a type of fine-tuning where the model is trained on instructions that specify the desired behavior for a given prompt. For example, you might instruct the model to "write a short essay about the history of artificial intelligence" or "translate this paragraph of English text into Spanish." By providing these instructions, you can guide the model's responses and ensure that they are relevant and accurate.
