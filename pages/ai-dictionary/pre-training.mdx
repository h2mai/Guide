# Pre-training

Pre-training refers to the process of training a model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it for specific tasks. This allows the model to learn general knowledge from the data, which can then be applied to a variety of downstream tasks. During pre-training, the model learns to predict missing words in a sentence, which helps it understand the structure of language and the relationships between words.
