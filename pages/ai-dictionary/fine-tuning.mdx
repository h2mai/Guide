# Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task by continuing its training on a smaller, task-specific dataset. For example, if you wanted to use a language model to translate English text into French, you would fine-tune the model on a dataset of English-French translations. This allows the model to specialize its knowledge to the task at hand, improving its performance.
